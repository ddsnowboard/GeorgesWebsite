        <h3 id="one">Collection Tips</h3>
        <p>Acting promptly to collect debts enhances the likelihood of recovering overdue accounts receivable. With each passing month a delinquent becomes less collectible. If you take your debtors to court to compel collection, the key to a successful
          judicial result is good paperwork.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer">This information is general response to a typical situation. It may not be applicable in every instance. The exact nature of your legal situation will depend on many facts not known to us at this time. You should understand that this advice and
          information is general and that your own situation may vary.</p>
        <h3 id="two">Mechanic's Liens</h3>
        <p>Mechanic’s Lien Claims are valuable and powerful collection tools. When done properly a Mechanic’s Lien Claim allows you to assert rights against the real estate and obtain payment directly from the property owner, even if you did not contract
          with the property owner and even if the property owner has already paid someone else for the work. Mechanic’s liens are particularly useful when your customer is insolvent, bankrupt or non-responsive. Mechanic’s Lien Claims are useful but can
          only be obtained by diligently complying with the relevant law. Lien requirements and deadlines vary from state to state and can be different depending on whether the property is residential or commercial. Prompt attention is important and it
          is usually a good idea to contact a construction attorney if a bill hasn’t been paid and the job has been completed for 60 days. Many people mistakenly believe a Mechanic’s Lien is passive – that the Lien Claimant must wait to be paid until
          the property owner sells the real estate before the Lien Claimant will be paid. Such a belief is false for two reasons – if a Petition to Enforce the Mechanic’s Lien is not filed with six months to a year (depending on the state), the Lien Claim
          expires no matter how otherwise meritorious it may be. Second, a Lien Claim may actively foreclose on the real estate, once the Lien Claim is adjudicated, just like an unpaid mortgage lender.</p>

          information is general and that your own situation may vary.</p>
        <h3 id="three">Lien Waiver</h3>
        <p>
          Often times a customer will ask that you execute a Lien Waiver in order to be paid. This can cause problems if you execute an “absolute” lien waiver in exchange for a partial payment. It is a good idea to review a Lien Waiver with an attorney if you are
          being asked to sign before being paid in full. Without intending to do so, an unqualified Mechanic’s Lien Waiver may waive all lien rights even if:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Payment is only partial. </li>
            <li>
              Work is continuing.</li>
            <li>
              Payment is dishonored by the bank. </li>
            <li>
              Or for any reason additional money is or may become due and owing.</li>
          </ol>
          To preserve Mechanic’s Lien rights, the remedy is a Qualified Lien Waiver, which puts third parties or property owners on notice that the waiving party is preserving some right to file a Mechanic’s Lien Claim in certain circumstances.</p>

        <h3 id="four">Bond Claims and Public Works Projects</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Federal projects (the "Miller Act") require a payment bond be posted by the general contractor where the contract is valued at $100,000.00 or more. Unpaid subcontractors and material suppliers must give written notice by certified mail, or
              by some other delivery method which requires a signature, to the general contractor and surety within 90 days of the last furnishing of labor or material. Relief is limited to subcontractors and material suppliers. (No "sub-sub contractors"
              or "sub-material suppliers” may avail themselves of the Miller Act provisions.)</li>
            <li>Non-federal public projects such as schools, municipal buildings, prisons, etc. often require a payment bond be posted by the general contractor. Unpaid subcontractors and suppliers must give written notice in compliance with statutory and
              bond requirements. Most payment bonds require Notice within 90 days of the last furnishing of labor or materials, but sometimes the Bond has a longer deadline to give Notice.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 id="five">Favorable Contract Terms</h3>
          <p>Whenever possible you should utilize contracts with terms favorable to your position including the following:
            <ol>
              <li>For corporate or limited liability debtors, a personal guaranty executed by the owner or some other employee will provide security and increase the likelihood that you will be paid. Many LLCs and corporations are undercapitalized. If the
                business becomes insolvent and still owes you money, a personal guaranty allows you recourse against another party.</li>
              <li>
                An attorney's fee clause in your contract can obligate your debtor to pay your attorney fees and court costs if a lawsuit is filed.
              </li>
              <li>You should also include a clause allowing you to recover the maximum interest allowed for your past due invoices in the event of default.
              </li>
              <li>You should ask your customer to list bank accounts and other information that will be useful if you have to file suit later.
              </li>
              <li>Limitation clauses which cap your exposure to counterclaims in the event of litigation will protect your business from unforeseeable risks.</li>
            </ol>

          <h2 style="font-family: Constantine, serif">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <h3 id="six">Are there any time limits to filing mechanic’s liens in Missouri and Illinois?</h3>
          <p>
            In Missouri, a lien claim must be filed within six months after the last date that labor or material was supplied to the jobsite. In most instances, a ten-day notice must be sent to the property owner before the lien is filed. Once the lien claim is filed,
            a lawsuit must be filed to enforce the mechanic’s lien.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Illinois, material suppliers and subcontractors must give a written Notice of claim to the property owner (or tenant) and any lender no later than 90 days after furnishing the last labor and materials to the jobsite. The lien claim must be filed within
            120 days of the last labor or materials delivered or used on the job site. Unlike Missouri, there is no requirement that 10 days elapse between the delivery of the Notice and the filing of the Lien. Once the lien claim is filed, a lawsuit
            must be filed to enforce the mechanic’s lien.</p>

          <h3 id="seven">Are there different rules for filing a lien on owner-occupied real estate in Missouri and Illinois?</h3>
          <p>
            In both Missouri and Illinois different rules apply where the real estate subject to the lien is an owner occupied residence. In both Missouri and Illinois different rules apply where the general contractor, who dealt directly with the property owner,
            wants to assert a lien. Different rules apply when the project is a new residential subdivision.</p>

            and information is general and that your own situation may vary.</p>
          <h3 id="eight">What information should a business' invoices contain to make an enforceable lien claim?</h3>
          <p>Invoices for material should show the date of delivery to the job site, not just billing date. They should list the item descriptions, unit price, extended prices and total prices and the invoice should also show the job address or a description,
            such as a lot number and subdivision.
          </p>
          <p>Invoices for labor should show the date of the work, the number of hours worked, the hourly rate and the total value of the hours worked per day. They should also state the job address or description.</p>
          <p>
            There is special language that is required to be on the contract or the invoices for a party that contracts directly with the property owner. Although both Missouri and Illinois require special language, each state’s wording is different.</p>

          <h3 id="nine">What can a business do when it receives a "bad check"?</h3>
          <p>
            In Missouri, a business may sue to recover a penalty of up to 3 times the face amount of the check, not to exceed $500.00, plus interest, court costs and an attorney's fee.</p>

          <h3 id="ten">When should a business file a lawsuit in Small Claims Court?</h3>
          <p>
            In Missouri, small claims suits may be filed for up to $3000.00; in Illinois, small claims suits may be filed for up to $5000.00. A corporation can represent itself. There are few delays or continuances. There are some disadvantages, too. No Small Claims
            Judgment can be a lien on real estate.</p>
